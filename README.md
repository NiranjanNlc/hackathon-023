With the release of robust large-language models (LLM's), such as ChatGPT, artificial intelligence (AI) can speak very similarly to humans. These LLM's are trained by using data primarily from English speaking data sources leaving room for improvement for non-English speaking data sources to perform natural language processing (NLP) research. 

 The purpose of this project is to create a front-end prototype of a website that hosts massive amounts of text data from languages used all over the world so that users can subscribe to our service so they can use this data to train machine learning and artificial intelligence models for natural language processing.
